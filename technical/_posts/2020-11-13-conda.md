## Environment export

Create a clean environment file using:

```(bash)
conda env export --from-history
```

### Including packages installed from additional channels

By default this does not include packages that were installed using the form
```conda install -c CHANNEL PACKAGE```, e.g. it does not work for PyTorch.

A solution, provided in [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62015577) is to first add the desired channels to the environment via:

```(bash)
conda activate <MY_ENV>
conda config --env --add channels <CHANNEL>
```

One can then install the desired packages **without** the `-c PACKAGE` option and those will be added to the environment generated using the `--from-history` flag, as well as the channels.
