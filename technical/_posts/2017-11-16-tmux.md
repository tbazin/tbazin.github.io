## `tmux-resurrect`

Source: [tmux-resurrect]

An extension to restore panes and programs as saved, even over system reboots.

> `tmux-resurrect` saves all the little details from your tmux environment so it
can be completely restored after a system restart (or when you feel like it).
No configuration is required. You should feel like you never quit tmux.

### Key bindings

- `prefix + Ctrl-s` - save
- `prefix + Ctrl-r` - restore
