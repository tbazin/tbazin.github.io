## Verbose mode

Option `-v` (can be used multiple times for increasing levels of verbosity) turns on verbose mode for debugging.

## Setting up public-key based authentication on a distant host

1. Generate a local priavte/public key pair using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`.
2. Push local public-key to the server:
    > `ssh-copy-id -i <path/to/identity-file> user@hostname.example.com`

    (this adds the key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file)

### Public-key based authentication not working

A possible explanation and solution is given in this blog post: https://www.daveperrett.com/articles/2010/09/14/ssh-authentication-refused/

This can happen if one manually creates the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

* Error (on host machine, could be found in `/var/log/secure` on host or returned by local `ssh` in verbose mode):
    > `Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory [remote]:~/.ssh.`

* Solution:
    > SSH doesn’t like it if your home or ~/.ssh directories have group write permissions. Your home directory should be writable only by you, ~/.ssh should be 700, and authorized_keys should be 600:

    ```bash
    $ chmod g-w /home/your_user
    $ chmod 700 /home/your_user/.ssh
    $ chmod 600 /home/your_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    > You can also get around this by adding StrictModes off to your ssh_config file, but I’d advise against it - fixing permissions is the way to go.

## Proxy-based ssh-ing

See this tutorial: https://doc.fedora-fr.org/wiki/SSH:_Simplifier_une_connexion_passant_par_un_Proxy

* Scenario:
    - Distant server located at `server-hostname` only accessible/visible on
    a private network accessed through a proxy-host at `proxy-hostname`

* Edit the local `~/.ssh/config` file with the following set-up:

```text
Host MYPROXYNAME  # only defines the local name for the host, can be chosen freely
    Hostname proxy-hostname  # valid host location, DNS or IP address
    User username-on-proxy  # username used to connect to the proxy

Host MYSERVERNAME  # again, can be chosen freely
    # HostName not necessary here
    User username-on-server  # username used to connect to the server from the proxy

    # tells ssh to first proxy through MYPROXYNAME using netcat
    ProxyCommand ssh MYPROXYNAME nc server-hostname 22
```

* `ssh MYSERVERNAME` then allows to directly connect to the server.
    - Can be used to reference the server in other tools (e.g. `rsync`) on the local machine.

## Setting up an SSH tunnel

* Can be useful e.g. to set-up a Tensorboard on a distant cluster and access it
locally.

* `ssh -N MYHOST -L :local-port:distant-address:distant-port`
    - `-N` allows to not open a terminal access to the distant machine and
    just leave the tunnel open.
    - `-L` specifies the creation of a *L* ocal connection, i.e. a tunnel.
    - `distant-address` is the address/IP/local 'Host' name of the distant
    machine ton bind to. This can be (in most cases) `MYHOST`'s address but can
    more generally be any machine accessible from `MYHOST`.

### Usage with Tensorboard

* Start a TensorBoard server on the distant cluster with the usual command:
    - `tensorboard --logdir path/to/logs/ --port MYPORT`
* With the tunnel open in the background
* TODO finish this
