## 1.1. Statistical Golems

## 1.2. Statistical rethinking

Discussion on the place of *falsification* in (statistical) science.
> "The greatest obstacle that I encounter among students and colleagues is the tacit belief that the proper objective of statistical inference is to test null hypotheses."

Two main points here:

> "Hypotheses are not models"

* Complex relations between research hypotheses, process models and actual statistical modeling of those processes. One statistical model can be appropriate for multiple, contradictory hypotheses, making strict falsification impossible.

> "Measurement matters"

* Data cannot always be trusted, so even if the modeling seems to be right it's not necessarily possible to conclude anything consensual.

### 1.2.1. Hypotheses are not models

An exemplified development on the general idea that there are no one-to-one relations between the three entities that are:

* *Research hypotheses*, which emerge from observations/data,
* *Process models*, conceptually proposed to explain the observed facts,
* *Statistical models*, concrete statistical implementations of the process models that can then be used to simulate behavior and compare to real data.

**Evolutionary biology example**

## 1.3. Measurement matters

Two examples to show that research hypothesis rarely lead to binary null hypotheses that can "easily" be falsified by providing a single counter-exemple.

First, the very notion of counter-examples is to be questioned when measurement errors can arise.

Second,
> Most interesting research questions in science are not of the kind 'all swans are white' but rather of the kind: \\[ \Hzero: \text{80\% of swans are white.} \\] or
> \\[ \Hzero: \text{Black swans are rare.} \\]
